I couldn't tell from the design doc if the header was static or not. I saw the box shadow on the bottom of the header and in my experience when I see that it usually corresponds with a static header so I made the header function that way.

The only JS I could think to add was a null checker for the zip code input.  If nothing is entered into the zip code input box then the browser will return an alert box message.

I checked the website in IE, Chrome, and Firefox and the website functions the same in all the browsers.
